	* scripts/player.js:
	Changed the script to work with the new replay format. This one also displays 
	player direction, neck direction, and stamina (via body color).

	* play.php: 
	- loading the .replay files from the replay subdirectory
	- removed one of the javascript dependencies

	* converter/rcg2replay.cpp: 
	This converter replaces the previous one, and is able to work 
	directly with .rcg files, i.e., no intermediate step is required.
	A very simple Makefile was also added - it will need the rcgbase
	library installed on your system.

	* logplay.css:
	fixed background image path
